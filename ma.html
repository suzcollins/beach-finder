                    <p class = "text">Wingaersheek is probably the best beach for families in Massachusetts. The water is very calm with hardly any waves. There are beautiful rocks and boulders in the water that are fun to climb on and searching for hermit crabs or sand dollars. There are lifeguards at this beach. There is snacks and ice cream located on the beach but it would be smart to pack lunch. There are also showers to rinse off in after a long day at the beach. The sand is smooth and is a bit more peaceful then other beaches in Gloucester.</p>
