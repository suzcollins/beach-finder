                <p class = "text">Welcome to Long Beach! There are certain sections dedicated for water sports but after 5 you can surf in any part of the beach. The beach is located on one of the main roads of York so if you cross the street, you'll find a variety of foods, shops, and arcades. Lifeguards are on the beach during the summer seasons. Bathrooms + showers are also located on the beach. You can park on the main road and you use the meter to pay. Liquid Dreams, a surf shop, is located directly across from the beach so you can easily rent a surfboard and wet suit for less then $15 for an hour.</p>

    <p class = "text">Higgens Beach is the perfect summer beach. There is great sand and big waves. The waves are great for boogie boarding which you can do all day and surfing which you can do after 5p.m. If you get to the parking lot after 3p.m the parking is $5 for the rest of the day, spots are limited (price depend on time of arrival.) There are not many restraunts around the area, only the Higgens Beach Inn which is seafood. But many other restraunts are located about a five minute drive away. Higgens beach also has a spot where you can lock up your surf board.</p>
