        <img class= "OGT" src = "https://newengland.com/wp-content/uploads/legacy_cms_images/13187-675x449.jpg">
        <p class = "ogtDescrip"> Ogunquit Beach is located in the town of Ogunquit, Maine. This beach is a boogie boarders, paddleboarders, and surfers paradise. With beautiful waves and crystal clear water, this is the ideal beach for families and anyone looking for a great time. A river meets with the beach which is perfect if you have a water tube to float down the river or catch crabs. Parking is tough during the summer months and can get pricey depending on which lot you go to. You cannot have a dog during the summer months but can off season. Ogunquit beach does have a few quick spots to eat at but a five minute walk away from the beach is the town of Ogunquit with a bunch of my personal favorite spots to eat. Loveshack Juicery is the best if you're looking for a healthy smoothie bowl or juice. Cornerstone if you're looking for artisian pizza and amazing homemade pretzels. Bread and Roses is perfect for a cup of iced coffee or any pastry. Rentals for SUP and surfboards are available at Liquid Dreams in Ogunquit or York and you can take lessons too. Restrooms and outdoor showers are available as well next to the beach. Lifeguards are on duty between June 20th and Labor Day. Beware of the seagulls, they are aggressive. </p>
